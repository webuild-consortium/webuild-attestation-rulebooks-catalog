# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project is part of the [WE BUILD](https://www.webuildconsortium.eu/) Large Scale Pilot, co-funded by the European Union, and brings together participants from diverse organisations, countries, and backgrounds. This Code of Conduct establishes expectations for respectful and productive collaboration in all project spaces.

## Expected behaviour

- Communicate respectfully and professionally, recognising that participants come from different cultures, organisations, and areas of expertise.
- Provide constructive, specific feedback focused on the work rather than the person.
- Approach disagreements in good faith and seek consensus through technical discussion.
- Respect the time and contributions of others, including maintainers and reviewers.
- Credit the work and ideas of others appropriately.

## Unacceptable behaviour

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks or insults.
- Sustained disruption of discussions or review processes.
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any events or communications related to this project.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening a GitHub issue or by contacting the project maintainers directly. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly. Maintainers are committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter. Appropriate action will be taken, which may include warnings, temporary restrictions, or permanent removal from the repository or consortium.
