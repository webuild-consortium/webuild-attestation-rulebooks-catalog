## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Document scope and purpose

*Provide a concise explanation of the purpose of the defined attestation type, explicitly stating 
why it exists and what its primary objective is within the context of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem*

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO DEFINE] 

### 1.2 Document structure

*Provide a brief overview of the Rulebook's sections and their purpose. The main
sections of the Rulebook SHOULD be*

- Chapter 2, which describes the attestation attributes and metadata in an 
encoding-independent manner. 
- Chapter 3, which specifies how the attestation
attributes and metadata are encoded in case the attestation complies with [ISO/IEC
18013-5] and/or [SD-JWT VC] and/or [W3C VCDM v2.0]. Each encoding SHALL be specified in a separate section or even in a separate chapter.
- Chapter 4, which specifies attestation usage.
- Chapter 5, which defines trust anchors
- Chapter 6, which defines revocation mechanisms
- Chapter 7, which provides compliance information

### 1.3 Keywords

*The following are the recommended keywords. Modify if necessary*

This document uses the capitalised keywords 'SHALL', 'SHOULD' and 'MAY' as
specified in [RFC 2119], i.e. to indicate requirements, recommendations and
options specified in this document.

In addition, 'must' (non-capitalised) is used to indicate an external
constraint, i.e. a requirement that is not mandated by this document, but, for
instance, by an external document. The word 'can' indicates a capability,
whereas other words, such as 'will', and 'is' or 'are' are intended as
statements of fact.

### 1.4 Terminology

*It is recommended to use the terminology defined in Annex 1 of ARF. For example,
the following text can be used.* 

This document uses the terminology specified in Annex 1 of the ARF.

## 2 Attestation attributes and metadata

*This section is used for defining all attributes that an
attestation of the defined type may contain. In this section
the attributes SHALL be defined in an encoding-independent manner (see ARB_06 in [Topic 12]). 
Each attribute can be mandatory, optional, or conditional, 
and it SHALL be specified in the corresponding section (see ARB_09 in [Topic 12]).*

*When attributes are defined, referring to attributes that
already exist in a catalogue of attestation attributes 
SHOULD be considered (see ARB_07 in [Topic 12]).*

*[Topic 12] of Annex 2 of the ARF defines the following High-Level Requirements with
respect to the Attestation Rulebooks*

**Requirements for QEAA**
* An attribute as meant in Annex V point a) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] 
SHALL be included (see ARB_11 in [Topic 12]). See also section 2.1. 
* One or more attributes or metadata representing the set of data meant in Annex 
V point b) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_13 in [Topic 12])
* One or more attributes representing the set of data meant in Annex V point c)  
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_16 in [Topic 12]).

of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_18 in [Topic 12]).
* One or more attributes or metadata representing the location meant in Annex V point h)
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included. This location SHALL 
indicate at least the URL at which a machine-readable version of the trust anchor to be
used for verifying the QEAA can be found or looked up (see ARB_20 in [Topic 12])

**Requirements for PuB-EAA**
* Αn attribute as meant in Annex VII point a) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] 
SHALL be included (see ARB_11 in [Topic 12]). See also section 2.1.

 VII point b) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_14 in [Topic 12]).
* Οne or more attributes representing the set of data meant in Annex VII point c) 
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_16 in [Topic 12]).
* Οne or more attributes or metadata representing the set of data meant in Annex VII point e)
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included (see ARB_18 in [Topic 12]).
* one or more attributes or metadata representing the location meant in Annex VII point h)
of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHALL be included. This location SHALL 
indicate at least the URL at which a machine-readable version of the qualified 
certificate that signed the PuB-EAA can be found or looked up. (see ARB_20 in [Topic 12]) 

**Requirements for non-qualified EAA**
* An attribute indicating that the attestation is an EAA should be included (see ARB_12 in [Topic 12]).
See also section 2.1.

[European Digital Identity Regulation] SHOULD be included (see ARB_17 in [Topic 12])
* Οne or more attributes representing the set of data meant in Annex V point e) of 
the [European Digital Identity Regulation] SHOULD be defined (see ARB_19 in [Topic 12]).
 * Οne or more attributes or metadata representing the location at which a machine-readable 
version of the trust anchor to be used for verifying the EAA can be found or
looked up SHOULD be defined. What this location indicates precisely is dependent 
on the nature of the mechanism used for distributing trust anchors, detailed in section 
5 (see ARB_21 in [Topic 12])

### 2.1 Introduction

*Briefly introduce the overall design and purpose of the specific attestation type 
defined by this Rulebook, including key decisions regarding its attributes and 
legal categorisation.* 

*According to Annex V point a) and Annex VII point a) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]
an indication, at least in a form suitable for automated processing, that the attestation 
has been issued as a QEAA or Pub-EAA SHALL be defined. Similarly, according to ARB_12
of [Topic 12] of Annex 2 of the ARF, a similar indication SHOULD be defined for non-qualified EAA.
This document defines the attribute "attestation_legal_category" which SHALL have
the value "QEAA" or "PuB-EAA" or "non-qualified-EAA".* 

*In the following subsections define in an encoding independent manner all 
mandatory, optional, and conditional attributes and metadata. In each subsection
provide a table of the following form:*

| **Data Identifier**                     | **Definition**                                    | **Data type**                                           | **Example value**       |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| *Provide a unique attribute identifier* | *Briefly describe the semantic of this attribute* | *Provide a type, e.g., integer, string, boolean, date.* | *Give an example value* |

*NOTE Data identifiers should be unambiguous, machine-readable where possible, and 
avoid natural-language ambiguities.*

# 3 Attestation encoding 

## 3.1 ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant encoding 
*If the attestation type supports the format specified in ISO/IEC 18013-5,
then in this section the ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant encoding of attributes and metadata 
should be defined.* 

*It is noted that (see ARB_02 in [Topic 12]) the Schema Provider SHALL analyse whether it must 
be possible for a User to present that type of attestation when the Wallet Unit 
and the Relying Party are in proximity and attestations are presented without 
using the internet. If so,the attestations must be issued in the ISO/IEC 18013-5-compliant 
mdoc format.*

*Furthermore, in this section a document type SHALL be defined, which SHALL be 
unique within the scope of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem (see ARB_05 in [Topic 12]).*

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO DEFINE THE ATTESTATION TYPE]

*Provide a list of available encoding formats and their specifications (e.g. encoding, maximum lengths, 
date formats, etc.). For example:*

- tstr, uint, bstr, bool and tdate are CDDL representation types defined in
  [RFC 8610].
    - Regarding type tstr: this document confirms that, as specified in [RFC
    8949], a tstr SHALL be encoded in UTF-8 and SHALL support the full Unicode
    range.
    - All attributes having encoding type tstr SHALL have a maximum length of
    150 characters.
    - This document specifies full-date as full-date = #6.1004(tstr), where tag
    1004 is specified in [RFC 8943].
    - In accordance with [RFC 8949], section 3.4.1, a tdate attribute SHALL
    contain a date-time string as specified in [RFC 3339]. In accordance with
    [RFC 8943], a full-date attribute SHALL contain a full-date string as
    specified in [RFC 3339].
    - The following requirements apply to the representation of dates in
    attributes, unless otherwise indicated:
        - Fractions of seconds SHALL NOT be used;
        - A local offset from UTC SHALL NOT be used; the time-offset defined in
        [RFC 3339] SHALL be to "Z".
    - [RFC 8949], section 4.2, describes four rules for canonical CBOR. Three of
    those rules SHALL be implemented for all CBOR structures, as
    follows:
        - integers (major types 0 and 1) SHALL be as small as possible;
        - the expression of the length in a bstr, tstr, array or map SHALL be as
        short as possible;
        - indefinite-length items SHALL be made into definite-length items.

*This section should include a table the data identifier specified in
Chapter 2, the corresponding attribute identifier to be used in
presentation requests and responses according to [ISO/IEC 18013-5] and the encoding 
of each attribute.*

*Additionally, the following rules should be followed:*

* When specifying new attributes, existing conventions 
for attribute identifier values and attribute syntaxes SHOULD
be considered (see ARB_07 in [Topic 12]).
* Each attribute SHALL be defined within an attribute namespace. 
  * An attribute namespace 
SHALL fully define the identifier, the syntax, and the semantics of each attribute 
within that namespace. 
  * An attribute namespace SHALL have an identifier that is 
unique within the scope of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, and each attribute 
identifier SHALL be unique within that namespace (see ARB_06a in [Topic 12]) 
  * A domestic namespace MAY be defined 
to specify attributes that are specific to this Rulebook and are not included in 
the applicable EU-wide or sectoral namespace (see ARB_10 in [Topic 12]). 

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** | **Namespace**|
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| family_name | family_name | tstr | com.example.att.1|

*The corresponding entry for the "attestation_legal_category" attribute defined
in Section 2.1 SHALL be:*

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** |**Namespace**|
|------------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| attestation_legal_category | attestation_legal_category | tstr |com.example.att.1|

Finally, illustrative examples SHALL be included.

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE THE ATTRIBUTES AND THEIR VALUES INCLUDED IN THE EXAMPLE]

### 3.2 SD-JWT VC-based encoding 
*If the attestation type supports the format specified in "SD-JWT-based Verifiable 
Credentials (SD-JWT VC)", then in this section the SD-JWT VC-compliant encoding 
of attributes and metadata SHALL be defined. It SHALL be ensured that the attestations 
comply with the 'SD-JWT VCs' profile specified in [HAIP] (see ARB_01b in [Topic 12]).*

*It is noted that a Schema Provider MAY specify in the Attestation 
Rulebook that that type of attestation must be issued in the [SD-JWT VC]-compliant 
format, provided the [SD-JWT VC] specification has been approved by an EU standardisation 
body or by the European Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to 
Article 46e(1) of the [European Digital Identity Regulation] (see ARB_03 in [Topic 12]).*

*In this section, a Verifiable Credential Type (`vct`) SHALL be defined,
which SHALL be unique within the scope of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem (see ARB_05 in [Topic 12]).*

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO DEFINE THE ATTESTATION TYPE]

*Additionally, when specifying new attributes, existing conventions 
for attribute identifier values and attribute syntaxes SHOULD
be considered (see ARB_07 in [Topic 12]).*

*Rulebook authors SHALL ensure that each claim name is either 
- included in the IANA registry for JWT claims,
- is a Public Name as defined in [RFC 7519], or
- or is a Private Name specific to the attestation type. (see ARB_06b in [Topic 12]).*

*For all claims (i.e. all top-level properties, all nested properties, and all array entries), 
the Rulebook SHALL specify whether an Attestation Provider MUST, MAY, or MUST NOT make that
claim selectively disclosable (see ARB_30 in [Topic 12]).*

*Rulebook authors SHOULD consider defining a Type Metadata Document for the attestation type 
specified in the Rulebook, as defined in Chapter 6 of [SD-JWT VC]. If such a document is defined,
it SHOULD contain the Claim Selective Disclosure Metadata (defined in Section 9.3 of [SD-JWT VC]) 
for each of the claims, in order to specify if that claim is selectively disclosable (see ARB_31 
in [Topic 12]).*

*Rulebook authors SHOULD consider defining a JSON Schema for the attestation type specified
in the Rulebook, as defined in Section 6.5 of [SD-JWT VC], and include or reference that 
Schema in the Type Metadata Document meant in ARB_31 (see ARB_32 in [Topic 12]).*

*IANA-registered claims should be presented in a table that
includes their data identifier, attribute identifier, 
encoding format, and reference or note. For example,*

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** |**Reference/Notes** |**Disclosable**|
|-------------------- |--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| family_name | family_name | string | Section 5.1 of [OIDC] | MUST |

*A similar table should be used for Public Names and for Private Names specific
to the attestation type defined in this document. For
example:*

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** | **Notes** |**Disclosable**|
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|
| trust_anchor | trust_anchor | string | The trust anchor defined in Section 5 | MUST NOT |

*The corresponding entry for the "attestation_legal_category" attribute defined
in Section 2.1 SHALL be:*

| **Data Identifier** | **Attribute identifier** | **Encoding format** | **Notes** |**Disclosable**|
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|
| attestation_legal_category | attestation_legal_category | string | Defined in Attestation Rulebook template |MUST NOT|


Finally, illustrative examples SHALL be included.

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUED SD-JWT (IN base64 ENCODING)]

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF A HUMAN READABLE VERSION OF THE SD-JWT PAYLOAD
AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURES INCLUDED IN THE EXAMPLE]



### 3.3 W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model-based encoding
*If the attestation type supports the format specified in W3C Verifiable Credentials 
Data Model, then in this section the corresponding encoding of attributes and 
metadata should be defined.* 

*It is noted that only a a non-qualified EAA can use this format (see ARB_01a in [Topic 12])*

*Tables similar to the ones specified in section 4 SHALL be defined.*

*This section SHALL reference one or more documents specifying in detail how a 
Relying Party can request attributes from a such an attestation, and how a User 
can selectively disclose attributes from such an attestation. Moreover, these 
referenced documents SHALL be approved by an EU standardisation body or by the European 
Digital Identity Cooperation Group established pursuant to Article 46e(1) of the 
[European Digital Identity Regulation] (see ARB_04 in [Topic 12]).*

*Finally, illustrative examples SHALL be included.*

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE HUMAN READABLE EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUED ATTESTATION]

[RULEBOOK AUTHOR TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROOF TYPE]

## 4 Attestation usage
*Briefly describe the primary use cases or scenarios for which this attestation 
type is intended*

*Additionally, in this section it SHOULD be specified whether a Relying Party receiving the attestation
must request and verify a PID (see ARB_27 in [Topic 12]). Also, beyond PID verification, 
it SHOULD be defined what other key obligations a Relying Party has when processing 
this attestation type (e.g. signature verification, freshness checks)*

*Furthermore, provide potential presentation requirements, e.g. are there specific 
requirements for how this attestation must be presented (e.g. online, offline, specific protocols)?*

*Finally, in this section information about potential transactional data
SHALL be defined (see [Topic 20] of Annex 2 of the ARF).*

## 5 Trust anchors

*Mechanisms for the provision of a trust anchor that SHALL
be used for the verification of an attestation SHALL be defined in this section.*

*It is noted that the ARF specifies the following for QEAAs and Pub-EAAs*

> To do this for [...] QEAAs the Relying Party Instance uses a trust anchor of 
the Provider obtained from a Trusted List. Note that the PID Provider or QEAA 
Provider may use an intermediate signing certificate to sign the PID or 
 attestation and use the trust anchor to sign the signing certificate, instead 
of signing the PID or attestation directly with the trust anchor.

> For PuB-EAAs, the Relying Party Instance verifies a PuB-EAA by first 
verifying the signature of the PuB-EAA Provider over the PuB-EAA, using the 
PuB-EAA Provider certificate issued by a QTSP. Subsequently, the Relying Party 
Instance verifies the signature over this certificate, using the corresponding 
trust anchor from the QTSP Trusted List. Note that both the PuB-EAA Provider 
and the QTSP may use an intermediate signing certificate. All other things 
being equal, the verification of a PuB-EAA will therefore involve one or more 
extra certificates, compared to the verification of a PID or QEAA.

*For non-qualified EAA in this section it SHOULD be defined (see ARB_26 in [Topic 12])
how the attributes or metadata representing the location at which a machine-readable 
version of the trust anchor to be used for verifying the attestation can be found,
specified in section 2, are used. This includes a detailed description about how
a Relying Party can obtain the trust anchor, as well as a detailed description about
how this trust anchor can be used for verifying that the provider is authorised
to issue the attestation. Additionally, for non-qualified EAA Provider this section
MAY include a description of mechanisms that can be used by a Wallet Unit for
verifying that the provider is authorised to issue this type of attestation (see 
ISSU_34 in [Topic 10])*




## 6 Revocation
(Refer to [Topic 7] of the ARF for a list of High-Level Requirements related to Revocation)

*In this section information about the revocation mechanism used SHALL be defined.* 

*For PID, QEAA, or PuB-EAA it SHALL be defined whether only short-lived attestations 
will be used, having a validity period of 24 hours or less, such that revocation 
will never be necessary, or that the attestations are revocable.* 

*For revocable attestations it SHALL be defined which of the following methods must be implemented:*
* Use an Attestation Status List mechanism included in a Technical Specification 
that will be specified by the Commission.
* Use an Attestation Revocation List mechanism included in a Technical Specification 
that will be specified by the Commission.

## 7 Compliance
*In this section explicitly state how this specific rulebook complies with the 
general EUDI framework, ARF, and relevant regulations*
